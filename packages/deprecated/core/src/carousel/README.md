# Carousel
This blocks shows a carousel based on bootstrap 4 carousel. Inside the edit function we use reactstrap which is a react component.
Because we implement the option to randomize images we must use server-side rendering.

## Customizable
The view is customizable, copy the index.blade.php to any project.

## Multiple carousel on the same page
In case of multiple carousels on one page adjust the carouselId attribute.
